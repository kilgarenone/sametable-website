<h1>About</h1>
<p>Sametable is a refreshing alternative to 1) The all-in-one collaboration tools, 2) Always-on work culture, and 3) Attention-grabbing collaboration tools.</p>
<p>The 'table' UI element that we all love plays a central role in Sametable. A table is where tasks are clearly laid out in individual rows. With a click, you can get a pulse on all of the tasks of a project by ordering the table by status, due date, or priority. It's that simple.</p>
<p>The tables are then complemented by embracing the venerable breadcrumb, effectively flattening the hierarchy of work organization-workspace, project, and task.</p>
<p>Then invite literally anyone talented outside of your organization with an email to join your workspaces.</p>
<p>Finally, enjoy writing details of projects and tasks in Markdown or rich text editor. Markdown are automatically rendered(hope that wasn't a horrible idea).</p>
<p>With Sametable as your command centre, you won't be working inside an app. Rather, you will be doing your best work in the real world with the best domain-specific tools. Come back to Sametable only when you need to.</p>
